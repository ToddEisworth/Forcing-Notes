<p>Suppose we are given a class <m>M</m> and relational class <m>E\subseteq M\times M</m>.  What should it mean to say that a sentence <m>\phi</m> of the language of set theory 
holds in the structure <m>\langle M, E\rangle</m>?  To address this question we introduce a new predicate ``<m>\models</m>'' (``satisfaction''), and define the meaning of 
<md>
\langle M, E\rangle\models \phi  
</md>
by a recursion on the structure of <m>\phi</m>.  
</p>
