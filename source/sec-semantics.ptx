  <title>Relativisation</title>

<p>Suppose we are given a class <m>M</m> and a sentence <m>\varphi</m> of the language of set theory.
What should it mean for the sentence <m>\varphi</m> to be ``true in <m>M</m>''?  Our goal in this section
is to define a correspondence <m>\varphi\mapsto\varphi^M</m> between formulas, and then to use this to 
provide an answer to this question.
</p>

\begin{<definition>
  Let <m>M</m> be a class.  Given a formula <m>\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)</m>
  of the language of set theory, the <term>relativization of <m>\varphi</m> to <m> M</m></term>
  is the formula <md>
    <mrow> \amp\varphi^{M}(x_1,\dots,x_n)  </mrow>
  </md>
  defined inductively by
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(x\in y)^{M}</m>  is the formula <m>x \in y</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(x=y)^{M}</m> is the formula <m>x=y</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(\neg\phi)^{M}</m> is the formula <m>\neg(\phi^{M})</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>

      <p>
        <m>(\phi\wedge\psi)^{M}</m> is the formula <m>\phi^{M}\wedge\psi^{M}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(\forall x\phi)^{M}</m> is the formula <m>(\forall x\in M)\phi^{M}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  with the other logical connections and <m>\exists</m> handled similarly.
</definition>

<p>
Note that since we have formulas (possibly with parameters) defining <m>M</m>, each formula 
of the form <m>\phi^{M}</m> is really just a formula in the language of set theory.
</p>

<definition>
  If <m>M</m> is a class and <m>\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)</m> is a formula with all free variables displayed,
  then in the metatheory we define
  <md>
    <mrow>M\models \varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n) \amp </mrow>
  </md>
  as an abbreviation of the formula 
  <md>
    <mrow>x_1\in M\wedge\dots\wedge x_n\in M\rightarrow\varphi^M(x_1,\dots,x_n) \amp </mrow>
  </md>
</definition>

<theorem>
  <statement> <p> Suppose <m>\Sigma</m> is a set of sentences and <m>\varphi(x_1,\dots, x_n)</m> is a logical
  consequence of <m>\Sigma</m>.  If <m>M</m> 
is a non-empty class and <m>M\models \Sigma</m>, then <m>M\models \varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)</m>.
  </p> </statement>
</theorem>

<corollary>
  <p>Suppose <m>\Sigma\cup\{\sigma\}</m> is a set of sentences and <m>\Sigma\vdash\sigma</m>. If <m>M</m>
    is a non-empty class and <m>M\models\Sigma</m> then <m>\sigma^M</m>.
