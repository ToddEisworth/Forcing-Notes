<p>Suppose we are given a class <m>M</m> and relational class <m>E\subseteq M\times M</m>.  What
   should it mean to say that a sentence <m>\phi</m> of the language of set theory 
holds in the structure <m>\langle M, E\rangle</m>?  
</p>

\begin{<definition>
  Let <m>M</m> be a class and let <m>E</m> be a binary relation on <m>M</m>.  Given a formula <m>\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n)</m>
  of the language of set theory, the <term>relativization of <m>\phi</m> to <m>\langle M, E\rangle</m></term>
  is the formula <md>
    <mrow> \amp\phi^{M, E}(x_1,\dots,x_n)  </mrow>
  </md>
  defined inductively by
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(x\in y)^{M, E}</m>  is the formula <m>x E y</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(x=y)^{M, E}</m> is the formula <m>x=y</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(\neg\phi)^{M, E}</m> is the formula <m>\neg(\phi^{M, E})</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(\phi\wedge\psi)^{M, E}</m> is the formula <m>\phi^{M, E}\wedge\psi^{M, E}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>(\exists x\phi)^{M, E}</m> is the formula <m>(\exists x\in M)\phi^{M, E}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  with the other logical connections and <m>\forall</m> handled similarly.
</definition>

<p>
Note that since we have formulas (possibly with parameters) defining <m>M</m> and <m>E</m>, each formula 
of the form <m>\phi^{M, E}</m> (which likely involves the symbols <m>M</m> or <m>E</m>) is 
really just a formula in the language of set theory.
</p>

<p>When the relation <m>E</m> is the standard <m>\in</m>, then we suppress the use of <m>E</m> in our
notation =-</p>
