  <title>The language of set theory</title>

  <p>Our version of the language of set theory will consist of a very few symbols together with some basic rules for how these symbols may be concatenated.
     The language incorporates the following symbols:
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-language">
    <statement>
      <p>
       The language of set theory, denoted <m>\lst</m>, consists of the following symbols:
      </p>
      <p>
        connectives <m>\quad\wedge</m> and <m>\neg</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        quantifier  <m>\quad\forall</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        variables  <m>\quad v_0, v_1, v_2, \dots</m>,
      </p>
      <p>
        parentheses   <m>\quad (\quad</m> and <m>\quad)</m>,
      </p>
      <p>
        the equality symbol  <m>\quad=</m>, and
      </p>
      <p>
       the membership symbol  <m>\quad\in</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Given our list of allowed symbols, the meaningful statements that can be expressed in our language are produced as follows:
  </p>

<definition xml:id="def-formula">
  <statement>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          An <em>expression</em> in the language of set theory is defined to be any finite string built from the symbols of <m>\lst</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We define a <em>formula</em> of the language of set theory to any expression generated using the following rules:
        </p>
        <ul> 
        <li>
        <p>
          <m>(v_i\in v_j)</m> and <m>(v_i=v_j)</m> are formulas (called <em>atomic</em> formulas) for any <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>
          </p>
        </li>
          <li>
          <p>
            If <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m> are formulas then so are <m>(\phi\wedge\psi)</m> and <m>(\neg\phi)</m>
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>
             If <m>\phi</m> is a formula then so is <m>(\forall v_i\phi)</m> for any <m>i</m>.
           </p>
         </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We let <m>\Form_{\lst}</m> denote the collection of formulas of <m>\lst</m> defined above.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </statement>
</definition> 

<p>The above is our official way of building formulas. We will shortly introduce the other standard logical 
   symbols as abbreviations of more complex formulas from <m>\Form_{\lst}</m>, but as we expand our language we want to keep in mind that the expressions and formulas in the augmented
   language are actually abbreviations of something written in <m>\lst.</m>  Our official language is more limited so that it is easier to make definitions and prove facts about
   <m>\Form_{\lst}</m> without needing to break into too many cases.   We illustrate the way this works with a couple of definitions and a lemma.
</p>

<definition>
<statement>
  <p> By recursion we define a function <m>\subform</m> that assigned to each formula <m>\phi</m> of <m>\lst</m> the set <m>\subform(\phi)</m> of all of its <em>subformulas</em></p> 
  <ul>
   <li>
     <p>
       If <m>\phi</m> is an atomic formula, then <m>\subform(\phi)=\phi</m>
     </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p>
     <m>\subform((\phi\wedge\psi))=\subform(\phi)\cup \subform(\psi)\cup\{(\phi\wedge\psi)\}</m>
     </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
      <m>\subform((\neg\phi))=\subform(\phi)\cup\{(\neg\phi)\}</m>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
      <m>\subform((\forall v_i\phi))=\subform(\phi)\cup\{(\forall v_i\phi)\}</m>
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The above function takes as input a formula <m>\phi</m> of<m>\lst</m> and returns the collection of all the formulas of <m>\lst</m> that are used to build <m>\phi</m>.  
</p>
<definition>
  <title>Free and Bound</title>
<statement>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <term>range</term> of an occurence of a quantifier <m>\forall v_i</m> in a formula <m>\phi</m>
      is the unique subformula <m>(\forall v_i\psi)</m> of <m>\phi</m> beginning with
      the occurence in question.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    An occurence of a variable <m>v_i</m> in a formula is <term>bound</term>
    if it is within the range of a quantifier of the form <m>\forall v_i</m>. Otherwise
    the occurence is <term>free</term>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A formula without free variables is called a <term>sentence</term>, and we 
      let <m>\Sent_{\lst}</m> denote the collection of sentences in our language <m>\lst</m>.
    </p>
  </li>
  
</ol>

</statement>
